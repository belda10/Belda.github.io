                <p class="spider-man-description">Spider-Man, created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962. The character follows the story of Peter Parker, a high school student who gains superhuman abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.</p>
                <p class="spider-man-description">With powers including wall-crawling, super strength, and a "spider-sense" that warns him of danger, Spider-Man uses his abilities to fight crime and protect New York City. His motto, "With great power comes great responsibility," reflects his commitment to using his powers for good, despite facing personal challenges and adversities.</p>
